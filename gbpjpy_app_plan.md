# GBPJPY Streamlit Application Plan

## 1. Information Gathering:

*   **Goal:** Understand the requirements and identify potential challenges.
    *   Use `read_file` to examine existing Streamlit apps or `search_files` to find relevant code snippets in the workspace (if any).
    *   Use `ask_followup_question` to clarify any ambiguities in the requirements.

## 2. Project Setup:

*   **Goal:** Create a new directory for the Streamlit application and initialize the necessary files.
    *   Create a new directory, e.g., `gbpjpy_app`.
    *   Create a `streamlit_app.py` file within the directory.

## 3. Core Functionality Implementation:

*   **Goal:** Implement the core logic for fetching data, calculating indicators, and creating the visualization.
    *   Implement data fetching using `yfinance`.
    *   Implement candlestick chart generation using `plotly`.
    *   Implement RSI calculation using `talib` or `pandas`.
    *   Implement EMA calculation using `pandas`.
    *   Combine the candlestick chart, RSI, and EMA plots into a single figure with subplots.

## 4. Streamlit Application Structure:

*   **Goal:** Structure the code into a Streamlit application with a title, chart display, and last updated timestamp.
    *   Use `st.title` to add a title to the app.
    *   Use `st.plotly_chart` to display the chart.
    *   Use `st.write` to display the last updated timestamp.

## 5. Automatic Data Refresh:

*   **Goal:** Implement the automatic data refresh mechanism using `time.sleep` and `st.experimental_rerun`.
    *   Implement a loop that fetches data, calculates indicators, and updates the chart every 5 minutes.
    *   Use `time.sleep` to pause execution for 5 minutes.
    *   Use `st.experimental_rerun` to refresh the Streamlit application.
    *   Synchronize the refresh with the real-world clock to ensure timely updates.

## 6. Error Handling and Edge Cases:

*   **Goal:** Implement error handling and address potential edge cases.
    *   Handle potential errors during data fetching.
    *   Handle cases where data is unavailable or incomplete.
    *   Implement appropriate logging and error messages.

## 7. Testing and Refinement:

*   **Goal:** Test the application thoroughly and refine the code based on the results.
    *   Run the application locally and verify that it functions as expected.
    *   Test the automatic data refresh mechanism.
    *   Refine the code based on the test results.

## 8. Documentation:

*   **Goal:** Add comments and documentation to the code.
    *   Add comments to explain the purpose of each code section.
    *   Add documentation to explain how to use the application.

## 9. Finalization:

*   **Goal:** Finalize the application and prepare it for deployment.
    *   Review the code and documentation.
    *   Prepare the application for deployment to Streamlit Cloud or another platform.
